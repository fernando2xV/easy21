# Easy21
- Application of several Reinforcement Learning methods to the game Easy21 (similar to BlackJack).
- Assignment can be found here: http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html or in the .pdf in the repository.

- The project is divided into the following sections:

  --> Implementation of Easy21 [environment.py]
  
  --> Monte-Carlo control in Easy21 [montecarlo.py]
  
  --> Values from Monte-Carlo run [mc.npy]
  
  --> Sarsa(lambda) in Easy21 [sarsa.py]
  
  --> Main script to run the different algorithms [main.py]
  
      # This file is divided into different parts: general settings, MC settings, Sarsa settings, MSE vs lambda settings, MONTE CARLO plotting, SARSA plotting.
      
      # For each main.py run, the unwanted sections should be commented out. Eg: For a MC run, all sections except general settings, MC settings amd MONTE CARLO plotting should be         commented out.
